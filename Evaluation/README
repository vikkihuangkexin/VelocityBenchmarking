    Velocity confidence and ridge line
    adata=velocity_confidence_plot(adata,input_dir,output_dir)

Input: An AnnData object. The object must contain velocity information (specified by vkey) within adata.layers. 
Additionally, UMAP coordinates and the velocity graph (computed via scvelo.velocity_graph()) must be pre-calculated.

Output: Returns a UMAP plot visualizing velocity confidence and a CSV file containing the raw velocity confidence values.

Follow-up: Subsequently, ridge_line.R will be generated to compare results across multiple tasks.
