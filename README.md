# Benchmarking algorithms for RNA velocity inference across single-cell multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics
We evaluated the performance, stability, scalability and usability of 29 velocity inference methods, including 20 RNA velocity inference methods, 7 multi-omics velocity inference methods, and 2 velocity-based cell cycle inference methods across 176 datasets.
